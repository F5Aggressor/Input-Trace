Services to Target IoT and Medium Manufacturing Companies
1. IoT Security Assessments
Deliverables:
Vulnerability scans and penetration tests for IoT devices (e.g., industrial control systems, sensors, PLCs).
Firmware analysis to identify weaknesses (e.g., default credentials, lack of encryption).
Risk assessments to understand how IoT devices impact the broader IT/OT environment.

Value Proposition:
Protect critical manufacturing operations from disruptions or ransomware attacks.
Meet industry compliance requirements like NIST 800-171 or CMMC if they work with DoD supply chains.
2. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) & Operational Technology (OT) Security

Deliverables:
Segmentation of IT and OT networks to minimize attack impact.

SIEM tuning for OT environments to detect abnormal behavior.

Incident response planning for OT-specific breaches.


Value Proposition:
Minimize downtime from cyberattacks, ensuring production continuity.
Provide visibility into the threat landscape for OT environments.


3. Ransomware Readiness Assessments
Deliverables:
Backup and disaster recovery (BDR) strategy assessments.
Simulated ransomware attacks (tabletop exercises or pen tests).
Anti-ransomware solution deployment (e.g., endpoint detection and response [EDR]).

Value Proposition:
Ensure resilience against ransomware attacks, avoiding costly operational shutdowns.
Improve business continuity planning.


4. Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk Assessments
Deliverables:
Vendor risk reviews for third-party suppliers or contractors accessing the network.
Compliance reviews for frameworks like NIST 800-171 or CMMC (if they serve government contracts).

Value Proposition:
Reduce the risk of supply chain attacks, ensuring they maintain trust with customers and partners.
Meet the growing compliance demands of larger partners.

5. IoT Device Security Implementation
Deliverables:
Device hardening (e.g., password policies, secure configuration).
Public key infrastructure (PKI) setup for device authentication and communication.
Secure patch management for IoT devices.

Value Proposition:
Prevent breaches originating from vulnerable IoT devices.
Enable secure and encrypted communication across the IoT ecosystem.

6. Cybersecurity Maturity Assessments

Deliverables:
Evaluate cybersecurity maturity against NIST CSF or ISO 27001 standards.
Provide a roadmap for improving maturity over time.

Value Proposition:
Offer leadership a clear view of where they stand and how to improve security cost-effectively.
Build their readiness for growth or future compliance requirements.

7. Managed Security Services (MSSP) for IoT Environments

Deliverables:
Continuous vulnerability monitoring for IoT devices.
SIEM monitoring tailored to manufacturing operations.
Monthly reports with security insights and recommendations.

Value Proposition:
Provide 24/7 monitoring at a fraction of the cost of building a SOC.
Detect and respond to threats in real-time.

8. Cybersecurity Awareness Training for IoT Users

Deliverables:
Training sessions for employees interacting with IoT/OT devices.
Gamified training focused on phishing, social engineering, and IoT-specific threats.

Value Proposition:
Reduce human error that could compromise IoT devices or networks.
Foster a culture of security awareness among employees.
How to Position Yourself in This Market
Understand Their Pain Points:

Many manufacturers are vulnerable to ransomware, phishing, and IoT-based attacks.
They often operate legacy systems with minimal visibility into their IoT/OT networks.

Focus on ROI:
Frame your services as preventing costly downtime or loss of intellectual property (IP).
Highlight that proactive security is cheaper than reactive incident recovery.

Leverage Industry Trends:
Stress the importance of securing IoT devices as a critical part of their Industry 4.0 transformation.
Use case studies of how ransomware has crippled manufacturing companies to illustrate the stakes.
Certifications to Boost Credibility:

ISA/IEC 62443 for industrial cybersecurity.
GIAC Industrial Cyber Security Certification (GICSP) for OT environments.
NIST and CMMC expertise for clients in regulated sectors.
Pricing Recommendations

Benchmarking:
IoT Security Assessments: $5,000–$15,000 per engagement, depending on device count.
ICS/OT Segmentation Projects: $10,000–$25,000+ for medium environments.
Ransomware Readiness Assessments: $7,500–$20,000 based on the size of the environment.
Managed IoT Security Services: $2,000–$5,000/month for continuous monitoring.

Variables:
Size of Client: Price larger manufacturers higher due to increased complexity.
Scope: Modular pricing for add-ons like compliance reviews or additional devices.
Customization: Premium pricing for tailored, hands-on services (e.g., custom firmware reviews).
